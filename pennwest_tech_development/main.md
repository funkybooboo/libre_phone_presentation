## GitHub

GitHub is the industry standard for code hosting and collaboration. Hiring managers *will* look here if you include it on your resume — and you absolutely should.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Central place to host and showcase your code  
- Makes your personal projects easy to share  
- Shows that you understand Git, which every dev team uses  
- You can contribute to open source and track your growth over time

## GitLab

GitLab is similar to GitHub, but with built-in DevOps features like CI/CD pipelines. Some companies (especially enterprise or self-hosted setups) prefer GitLab, so it’s good to be familiar with both.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Understanding GitLab shows you can work with full dev workflows  
- Great for learning about automated testing, deployments, and CI/CD  
- Some open-source projects are GitLab-only — more contribution opportunities

## CodeCrafters

CodeCrafters is one of the best ways to go beyond tutorials and build real developer tools from scratch — things like Git, SQLite or Redis.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Shows you understand how things *actually* work under the hood  
- Projects like “Build Git in Go” look amazing on a resume  
- Prepares you for deeper technical and system design interviews  
- Gives you something impressive to walk through in interviews

## LeetCode

LeetCode is essential for mastering technical interview questions. The problems here are often pulled directly into interviews at big tech companies.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Builds problem-solving skills for technical phone screens and onsite interviews  
- Practicing here gives you confidence and speed  
- Employers love to see a track record of daily practice  
- Share your LeetCode stats or problem streak on your resume or LinkedIn

## HackerRank

HackerRank is another top-tier platform for practicing coding challenges, with an added focus on certifications and employer-sponsored competitions.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Practice real-world coding questions across multiple domains (algorithms, SQL, security, etc.)  
- Earn certificates in specific skills (these look great on a resume)  
- Some companies use HackerRank as a screening platform for hiring  
- You can get noticed by recruiters through ranked competitions

This site helps you find beginner-friendly tasks in real open-source projects. It’s perfect if you want to contribute to the developer community and learn how large-scale codebases work.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Adds real-world collaboration to your resume  
- Gives you experience with issue tracking, pull requests, and code review  
- Recruiters love to see “open-source contributor” on your resume  
- Great way to learn by doing

## Dice

Dice is a job board specifically for tech roles — no random listings, just relevant jobs in software development, data, IT, and engineering.

**How it helps you get hired:**  
- Search by skill (Python, React, SQL, etc.) to find roles tailored to you  
- Research job descriptions to see what skills employers are asking for  
- Find salary data and hiring trends in tech  
- Build a profile and get matched to jobs automatically

## How It All Comes Together

To stand out in the job market, you want to have more than just a degree. Employers are looking for:

- **A clean GitHub or GitLab profile** with real projects  
- **Problem-solving skills** proven by LeetCode or HackerRank progress  
- **Hands-on experience** from CodeCrafters or open-source contributions  
- **Certifications** or achievements that show you’re serious  
- **A tech-specific resume** that links to all of the above

Here’s a quick strategy you can follow starting now:

1. **Pick one or two platforms** to focus on each month.  
2. **Start or improve a project**, and document the process on GitHub.  
3. **Solve 1-2 coding challenges a day** on LeetCode or HackerRank.  
4. **Try contributing to open source** via Good First Issue.  
5. **Use Dice to find job listings** that match your growing skillset.
